			<p style = "text-align: justify;"> The branch of knowledge that deals with the creation and use of technical means and their interrelation with life, society, and the environment, drawing upon such subjects as industrial arts, engineering, applied science, and pure science. The term "Technology" is wide, and everyone has their way of understanding its meaning. We use technology to complete various tasks in our daily lives. We use technology to extend our abilities, making people the most essential part of any technological system. </p>
			
			<br>

			<p style = "text-align: justify;"> Technology is also an application of science used to solve problems. The science or study of the practical or industrial arts, applied sciences. The purposeful application of information in the design, production, and utilization of goods and services, and in the organization of human activities.
			Technology can be described in the following ways:
			Tangible: blueprints, models, operating manuals, prototypes.
			Intangible: consultancy, problem-solving, and training methods.
 </p>		

			<br>
			
			<p style = "text-align: justify;"> We apply technology in our daily use, we use technology at work, and we use technology for communication, transportation, learning, industrial, securing data and so much more.  Technology is human knowledge which involves tools, materials, blueprints, models and systems. The presentation of technology naturally results in products. If technology is well functional, it welfares humans, but the vice-versa is true, if one uses for cruel reasons.

			<h2 style = " text-decoration: underline; color: orange;"> <strong>  Impact of Technology on Employment & Unemployment </strong> </h2>
			<h5> 5th September , 2019. </h5>

			<br>

			<p style = "text-align: justify;">Technologies have been renowned for altering life for the better and simplifying the job process for us since ages. But some conservative thinkers are making it, the long-discussed subject, with the latest concern that technology progress is causing unemployment by altering the workplace system. </p>

			<br>

			<p style = "text-align: justify;"> In their view, with the technological development,<mark> the labor market will decrease drastically and will be replaced by a machine</mark>, creating unemployment due to technology. 
			The day doesn't seem far away when Artificial Intelligence produces robots that can take over human beings entirely, and in this situation, it is a matter of concern that what will be the effect of technology on the workplace. There is no doubt that technological change has affected the quantity, manner and circumstances in all workplaces. For those curious about how technology destroys employment?
			Need to consider the fact that technology generated fresh employment for individuals who kept pace with it at the same time. But many individuals today think that technology's effect on job destruction is more prominent than their creation.  </p> <!--Use of additional tag MARK-->

			<br>

			<p style = "text-align: justify;"> It is terrible to explore how each new progressive technology has impacted our lives and how it will influence the future. Technology impacts the environment, people and the society. The way we use technology decides if its impacts are positive to the society or negative.  For example, we can use corn to make ethanol and this ethanol can be used as fuel. Fuel can be used to run machines and cars which will surely increase the output of manufacturing industries at a lower cost. Yet, if we decide to shift large quantities of corn to fuel production from food production, humans will be left with no food and this will cause world hunger which even is a worse situation. </p>

			<br>

			<br>

			<h3 style = " text-decoration: underline; color: orange;"> <strong> Positive impacts of Technology  </strong> </h3>

			<p style = "text-align: justify;"> Technology also has a great impact on all the important aspects of all our cultures including laws and how they are enforced, language, art, health care. For example the great technological improvements in health care have given a chance to doctors to treat their patients in an environment that is virtual through the use of mediums such as video conference. Transportation has been highly benefited from technology, driver-less car technology has change the world as well as living standard of people, it is claimed to be safer as human risk factor is less. Due to technology, the world has become more advanced and will be even more advanced in the future.   </p>

			<br>

			<br>

			<h3  style = " text-decoration: underline; color: orange;"> <strong> Negative impacts of Technology  </strong> </h3>

			<p style = "text-align: justify;"> But not everybody is unwilling to alter as a result, new technology has a big effect on local work possibilities and this is:
			Computers replace most of the blue collar jobs that create fear of work loss.
			By eliminating human errors and risk factor, the use of the device improves effectiveness and performance. This destroys unqualified labor employment.
			Technology and unemployment are two sides of the same if one is unable to cope with the change in technology then there is an equal opportunity for them to face unemployment.
			The pace of advancement in technology is so drastic that workers can not keep track of it.
			Inequality of income is growing quickly.
			Computers never get tired but humans do.
 </p>

			<br>

			<br>

			<h3 style = " text-decoration: underline; color: orange;"> <strong> Conclusion  </strong> </h3>

			<p style = "text-align: justify;"> Based on the instances above, technology by its self is never harmful to the society because we can give commands to it, but the way people uses technology to achieve specific goals is what results into negative impacts of technology on the society. Humans need to use energy to process products in factories, to run cars, to light homes and also run technological machines like computers, but the only way we can do this without affecting the environment and society is by shifting from exhaustible energy sources to renewable like Solar / Wind energy. </p>
